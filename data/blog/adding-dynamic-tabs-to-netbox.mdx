In order to add a dynamic tab to a NetBox object, whether it's a core object(ex. Device, Device Type) or a user defined object we need a table to act as a map which states which kind of tab corresponds to which object. To do that we can define a Django model like this:

```python
from django.db import models

class TabMap(models.Model):

    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            models.UniqueConstraint(fields=('object_type', 'object_id', 'tab'),
                                    name='unique_object_type_object_id_tab'),
        ]

    class Tab(models.TextChoices):
        CUSTOMTAB = 'CUSTOMTAB', 'Custom Tab'

    class ObjectType(models.TextChoices):
        DEVICE = 'Device', 'Device'

    object_type = models.CharField(max_length=30, choices=ObjectType.choices)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    tab = models.CharField(max_length=30, choices=Tab.choices)
```

As we can see `TabMap` has three fields which maps a specific `object_id`(ex. 2) which has a specific `object_type`(ex. Device) to a specific `tab_id`.

Then we need to register a tab with it's own template for the object type that we want to have the said tab:

```python
from dcim.models import Device
from netbox.views import generic
from utilities.views import ViewTab, register_model_view

@register_model_view(Device, name='custom_tab')
class CustomDeviceTab(generic.ObjectView):
    template_name = 'my_netbox_plugin/custom_device_tab.html'
    tab = ViewTab(label='Custom Tab',
                  badge=has_tab(tab=TabMap.Tab.CUSTOMTAB),
                  weight=10000,
                  hide_if_empty=True)
    queryset = Device.objects.all()
```

In here using `register_model_view` decorator we specified that we want to create a tab for the `Device` object type and with a relative path of `custom_tab`(for example the tab's URL would be something like *my-netbox-instance.net/dcim/devices/2/custom_tab/*).

In `template_name` we specified that we want to use `my_netbox_plugin/custom_device_tab.html` as the template of our tab.

Finally using the `tab` field and NetBox's `ViewTab` class we can give a `label`, `badge`, `weight`(used for ordering the tab between the already present list of tabs, lower values push the tab to left while the higher values push it to the right) and lastly `hide_if_empty`(which hides the tab if it's badge doesn't have a meaningful value).

Also `badge` accepts a simple value like string or a callable with object's id as first argument like for example a function and as you can see in the above code snippet we have provided a function named `has_tab` which itself returns a function to be used by the `badge` field. The definition of the function is below:

```python
def has_tab(tab):

    def get_badge_value(object):
        if TabMap.objects.filter(object_type=object.__class__.__name__,
                                 object_id=object.id,
                                 tab=tab).exists():
            return 'Custom Badge'

    return get_badge_value
```

`has_tab` accepts a `tab`(basically a value of the `Tab` enum we defined in `TabMap` Django model) and returns a function named `get_badge_value` which accepts an object id as `object` and returns a value as tab's badge if the tab has been registered for that object.

Ultimately we define a new view named `register_tab` with the responsibility of registering a tab for a certain object using the provided query strings: `object_type`, `object_id` and `tab`:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

from . import models

def register_tab(request):
    object_type = request.GET.get('object_type')
    object_id = request.GET.get('object_id')
    tab = request.GET.get('tab')

    if object_type not in models.TabMap.ObjectType:
        raise Exception(
            f'Object Type: `{object_type}` is invalid, make sure that you have defined it in `ObjectType` enum'
        )
    if tab not in models.TabMap.Tab:
        raise Exception(
            f'Tab: `{tab}` is invalid, make sure that you have defined it in `Tab` enum'
        )

    models.TabMap.objects.get_or_create(object_type=object_type,
                                        object_id=object_id,
                                        tab=tab)

    return HttpResponseRedirect(request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER'))
```

Don't forget to register this view in your *urls.py* file:

```python
from django.urls import path

from . import views

path('register_tab/', views.register_tab, name='register_tab')
```

Then in order to register the `Custom Tab` tab for a `Device` with the id of `2` we invoke this view like so:

```html
<a href="{% url 'plugins:my_netbox_plugin:register_tab' %}?object_type={{ object_type.DEVICE }}&object_id={{ 2 }}&tab={{ tabs.CUSTOMTAB }}">Add Custom Tab</a>
```

Notice that in here we have passed `Tab` and `ObjectType` enums as extra context values `tabs` and `object_type` respectively.
