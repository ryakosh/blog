### Python ternary operator:

Well apparently this feature was available in python for a somewhat long time, It's weird that i didn't learn about it until recently:


```python
condition = (2 * 2) == 4
return_this = '2 multiplied by 2 is 4'
return_this_instead = '2 multiplied by 2 is not 4!'

return_this if condition else return_this_instead
```

### Python functions can return a function:

Yeahhh... I believe I should've known this by now...:


```python
def gimme_string(str):
   def repeat_the_string_times(n):
      return str * n
   
   return repeat_the_string_times

repeat_the_string_times = gimme_string('HA')
print(repeat_the_string_times(10)) # This returns 'HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA'
