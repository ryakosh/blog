## Who are you?

I’m Arya or ryakosh.

## Purpose

Well, You see… I’m a very forgetful person, I mean I really like learning about programming and the world that surrounds it, However, When I try to learn new stuff and after I’m done experimenting with them or implementing what I intended with them I kinda forget about some of the syntax and logic behind them or sometimes I come up with a good idea of how to solve a certain problem and after few weeks I forget what I did to solve that problem and I have to rethink it, So by creating this blog I intend to remind myself of what I learnt and did, maybe I’ll be able to help you too!.
